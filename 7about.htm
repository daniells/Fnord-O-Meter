The word FNORD! was coined by <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Anton_Wilson">Robert Anton Wilson</a> and first appears in his pardoy scripture <a target="_blank" href="http://www.principiadiscordia.com/">The Principa Discordia</a>.  In his <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rawilson.com/illuminatus.html">Illuminatus! Trilogy</a> it was a word that was literally invisible to the conscious mind.  Fnord! was a panic trigger and was printed in newspapers and magazines: sprinkled liberally within the bodies of regular features.  The only place it did not appear was in advertisements.<br>
<br>
In the novel, the Fnords were only visible to the enlightened.<br>
<br>
In this context we #memers are using using <i>Fnord</i> to refer to what Psychistorians call <i>fantasy words</i>, or emotive terms that resonate with body feelings and emotions tied to subconscious memories of birth and childhood.  Fantasy analysis is the art of bringing the Fnords to light.  Of revealing the hidden messages within political speech and writing.  We feel that this is a precise, if literalistic interpretation of Wilson's allegory.<br>
<br>
<a target="_blank" href="group_fantasy_words.txt">Our Fnord words</a> are taken from the books <a target="_blank" href="http://www.psychohistory.com/htm/contents.htm">Foundations of Psychohistory</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.psychohistory.com/htm/eln01_leader.html">The Emotional Life of Nations</a> by Lloyd deMause.  <br>
<br>
In deMause's Group Fantasy Analysis there are no subjects or objects (and as we'd like to argue, no nouns either).  These only represent the rational surface of the conscious mind.  The Fnord-O-Meter will filter rational words, count the number of uses of each Fnord, and also deliver a gross word count that excludes some pronouns and prepositions.<br>
<br>
Theoretically, group fantasy analysis does not have to be limited to the talk of presidents or New York Times articles on foreign policy; what William Gibson would call "the nodal points". It could  extend to even the most pedestrian Reader's Digest material and street corner conversations.<br>
<br>
Statistical analysis of an entire news stand's worth of publications, conducted day by day, could give a a moving picture of the psychic landscape.  Daily spidering of blogs, news sites, livejournals, and the like could provide wonderfully rich statistical samples, and allow analysts to accurately predict how a nation will act, or at least <i>re</i>act to a political stimulus at any given time.<br>
<br>
In fact, we'd be surprised if intelligence agencies and political consulting firms aren't already doing this.<br>
<br>
Obviously such ambitious projects are well beyond the means of #memes, but we do find this tool of ours edifying, and hope you will too. <br>
