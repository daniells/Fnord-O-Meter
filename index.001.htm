            <b><big>About This Site</big></b><br /><br /> First formalized in 1974 by Lloyd DeMause, the discipline of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychohistory"><i>psychohistory</i></a> traces its underpinnings back a century or more.<br /><br />  Combining sociology, psychology, and statistics; psychohistory attempts to reveal the unconscious motives behind political trends. Statistical analysis has traditionally been the most laborious part of the job.  The method demands painstaking reading of political speech and print journalism. The hypnotically boring passages must be stripped away, leaving only emotionally charged words and metaphors.  These are parsed into a coherent narrative of the unconscious mind. <br /><br />   The resulting passages and subsequent matrix analyses of theme repetition produce a quantifiable picture of a political atmosphere, not to mention a predictor of the nation's future. <br /><br /> At least in theory. The tenants and methodologies are extremely controversial.  Despite the success of its spin-off discipline, <i>psychobiography</i>, PH proper is usually dismissed as quackery by mainstream academics.<br /><br /> While not systematically complete, this web-based tool is designed to take the drudge work out of PH text analysis and allow both  casual and serious students to test its hypotheses for themselves.<br /><br /> Click any of the <span id="about_the_name" class="infobutton buttonshadow">?</span> buttons to learn more about the tool.<br /><br />

            <b><big>About The Name</big></b><br /><br /> 
            There is no small overlap between psychohistory and speculative fiction.<br /><br />  The name itself is often confused with the imaginary field of psychohistory invented by Issac Asimov, which he made the central premise of his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Foundation_Series"><i>Foundation</i></a> novels.  In these books, mathematician Hari Seldon and his successors use statistical models to predict the decline of a glactic empire. With thier analytical tools they struggle to save human civilization from a new dark age. Anyone familiar with DeMausian psychohistory can draw obvious parallels with the ambitions and methodods of the discipline. <br /><br /> In his dadist trilogy, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminatus"><i>Illuminatus!</i></a>, Robert Anton Wilson wrote about the psychologically-charged word <i>fnord</i>.<br /><br /> In Wilson's dystopia the general public was conditioned from childhood to suppress conscious awareness of the word when they encountered it in print. Nonetheless it inspired feelings of dread and confusion in the reader.  This effect was employed by leaders to manipulate the public into irrational enmities and empty consumerism. The word, Anton wrote, is not actually "fnord" but it is used as a stand-in for real words the readers of his novel would not be able to percieve.<br /><br /> Again, it's easy to notice the similarity between psychohistory's phrases of unconscious emotional power and Anton Wilson's invisible words. <br /><br /> There is no indication within pshychohistory that these novels have influenced it. Likewise, they make no reference to DeMause. Instead it appears the same ideas have arisen independently.  Likely they are spontaneous outgrowths of psychological observations extant in modern consciousness.

            <b><big>More About ""Group Fantasy"</big></b><br /><br /> 
            One of the primary concepts in PS theory is the idea of <i>group fantasy</i>, the unconscious ideologies individuals and nations use to rationalize their behaviors. At any moment the body politic is shifting between one of four emotional stages: <i>strong</i>, <i>cracking</i>, <i>collapse</i>, and <i>upheval</i>. The type of words and metaphors found on the front page of newspapers, and in seminal political speeches, indicate which fantasy the group is immersed in and which stage is coming next.<br /><br /> These stages correspond with waypoints in the <i>fetal drama</i>: an unconscious story arc common to all humanity.  In the womb a growing infant goes from blissful comfort to increasing constriction.  This climaxes in the terrifying, hypoxic struggle of birth. The association of growth with crisis is thus imprinted on every human psyche.  As we go through life, people and nations repeat or <i>restage</i> this pattern: acting it out in our own lives or forcing it on others.  Thus childhood demonstrations of autonomy are often met with punishment and periods of economic expansion are often followed by the drumbeat of war...
