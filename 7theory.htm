<blockquote><i>The unconscious does not know the negative.</i><br> - Sigmud Freud</blockquote>

Psychohistorical analysis is much like classical psychoanalysis, only instead of studying the subconscious imagery from an individual, this scrutiny is turned upon a body politic.  In this sense the practice could be considered Jungian, as the study is of the collective unconscious. The flavor of this discipline, however, is distinctly Freudian and non-mystical.<br>
<br>
The public and private speeches of presidents, prime ministers, generals, and top legislators are the usual subjects for group-fantasy analysis.  These people are considered expert mirrors of the unconscious desires of their nations.  The output of the popular press can also be examined.<br>
<br>
Historical group fantasies are generally seen as passing through one of four phases as outlined in table below:<br>

In psychohistorical terms this is "The Fetal Drama".  Each stage is an emotional paralel of the trials of the human infant before and during birth.<br>
<br>
In the <u>Strong</u> stage the leader is seen as young (consider all the discussion of Bush II's "youth", even though he was 54 at the time of his first inaugural) and all-powerful.  Christ-like. A father figure and savior.  He is portrayed as great and nurturing. Even maternal.  The nation feels secure and hopeful. The fetal paralel is a happy baby in a roomy womb.<br>
<br>
In the <u>Cracking</u> stage the leader is seen as poisoned, impotent, and stagnating. He is mocked and ridiculed by the nation, his policies and proposals are ignored.  Like an old, weak king that must be sacrificed to renew the land, his time is almost up.  The nation feels bloated and pregnant with its own perceived corruption.  Other themes prevalent in the popular press and media will be disease, decay, filth, and pollution.  The fetal paralel is a cramped baby suffering increasing tightness and oxygen deficiency as the mother's walls close around it.<br>
<br>
In the <u>Collapse</u> stage the leader is seen as helpless, falling apart.  The nation is beset on all sides by imagined enemies and feels choked, strangled and crushed.  In this stage the leader must quickly strike out at an enemy or be the victim of a regicide.  Kennedy and Reagan were both shot during this phase of their presidencies: JFK because he failed to go to war over the Cuban missile crisis, Reagan for failing to war with Iran over the Tehran hostage crisis.  The fetal paralel is a suffocating baby in a breaking amniotic sac, strugging for life moments before birth.<br>
<br>
In the <u>Upheaval</u> stage the leader declares war on another nation, sacrificing children to the enemy. If he fails to provide a war he becomes the enemy himself.  This has its historical echo in the practice of killing kings when they were seen to become weak and ineffective. War brings an intense feeling of relief to the paranoid nation.  It is a catharsis: the fetal paralel is birth.<br> 
<!-- br>
As consciousness first appears (roughly the 42nd day of conception) the tiny fetus basks in a blissful amniotic sea. As it becomes larger its demands on the mother's placenta for food and oxygen increase: more and more it suffers the anxiety of hypoxia and acute toxicity of the blood.  To restore chemical balance the baby must engage in ritual combat with the placenta: kicking it to stimulate blood flow.  This is why young children kick the walls of their cribs.  This early fight for life is the primogenitor of all human wars.<br>
<br>
The child in the womb becomes more and more crowded, and eventually the amniotic sack cracks.. breaks.

The analysis of fantasy words, images, and phrases in the speeches of leaders, press articles, and political cartoons can give insight into the unconscious emotional struggles of a country.  Each stage is typified by its own group of images and emotive words.<br>

Correctly identifying the current stage can allow the Psychohistorian to predict the next...<br>
