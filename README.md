# Fnord-O-Meter 
###### A meme-splice of Wilson, DeMausse, and Asimov


##### What

This project will create a Nametag app to find [group fantasy words](http://books.google.com/books?id=V8Sas74bBjwC&pg=PA134&lpg=PA134&dq=%22group-fantasy+analysis%22&source=bl&ots=M5eM12T_E0&sig=CZRnfzxmtT9sahP67ZJCXGExPYo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iZ45VNDMLoWfyQSpioDwBg&ved=0CDUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22group-fantasy%20analysis%22&f=false) in text.


##### Why

* an example of group fantasy analysis that makes it easy to grasp
* A demonstration of how to write a parsed-text display in Nametag 



##### History

The #memes channel on DALnet was once a hotbed of bizzare ideas.  One we actually followed through was the Fnord-O-Meter, specced by channel users and written by yegs.  

The date on 5th-gen copy of the original html file is 1/5/07.  Miraculously, that sounds right. 

There was an early version of a jQuery-based Fnord-O-Meter in 2011 or so, but that code was lost.  This is a do-over-do-better of the AJAXish upgrade.

##### Planned Features

Who knows how much of this I'll ever have time to do

* Simple sequential display
* Sequential display with proximal nouns 
* Frequency ordered display
* Results files using TrustFS
* Categories and other metadata on results files
* AJAXy url-based page parsing
* Pages fetched and parsed automatically, periodically, based on a pref file
* D3 Trend graphing from results files


##### Path

* Refactor old code into cell-based list output
