# Fnord-O-Meter 
###### A splice of Robert Anton Wilson, Lloyd deMausse, and Issac Asimov

#### What

This is a [Hypertag](http://hypertag.io) web application that produces rudimentary statistics on [group fantasy words](http://books.google.com/books?id=V8Sas74bBjwC&pg=PA134&lpg=PA134&dq=%22group-fantasy+analysis%22&source=bl&ots=M5eM12T_E0&sig=CZRnfzxmtT9sahP67ZJCXGExPYo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iZ45VNDMLoWfyQSpioDwBg&ved=0CDUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22group-fantasy%20analysis%22&f=false) in texts supplied by users.

Group fantasy analysis is central to the pseudoscientific discipline known as [Psychohistory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_deMause).  It is the invention of Lloyd deMause, who first wrote about it in 1974.  

Psychohistory purports to apply statistical methodology to social and political sciences, and thus predict the political future. This supposed methodology has never been published. 

This sounds suspiciously like the central conceit of Isaac Asmimovs's [Foundation science fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series) novels.  He also called this very similar fictional discipline [Psychohistory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychohistory_%28fictional%29).  The first Foundation novel was published in 1942.

Central to the theory of group fantasy words is the idea that embedded in hypnotically-boring political speeches are emotive that contain unconscious content. When strung together as sentences these express the true ideology of the nation, or at least its ruling classes. 

This is suspiciously like the idea of the invisible word [FNORD!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fnord#Origins) first coined by [Kerry Thornley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_Wendell_Thornley) in 1965.

#### Why

* To be a demonstration of Hypertag applications
* To be an example of Psychohistory's _group fantasy analysis_ that makes it easy to grasp
* A tool for informally testing _group fantasy_ theory
* Predicting the political future
* Seeing the FNORDS!

#### When

This project started ~2003 as a slapdash web tool whipped up by some friends on IRC.  

It was then resurrected from Archive.org and refactored as a jTag app in 2007.  jTag was the early precursor of Hypertag: a high-level web application language that supports rich, recursive interfaces

This new 2015 version is a Hypertag rewrite.
