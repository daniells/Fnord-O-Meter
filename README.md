# Fnord-O-Meter 
###### A confluence of Robert Wilson, Lloyd deMausse, and Issac Asimov

#### What

This is a [Hypertag](http://hypertag.io) web application that performs rudimentary [group fantasy analysis](http://books.google.com/books?id=V8Sas74bBjwC&pg=PA134&lpg=PA134&dq=%22group-fantasy+analysis%22&source=bl&ots=M5eM12T_E0&sig=CZRnfzxmtT9sahP67ZJCXGExPYo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iZ45VNDMLoWfyQSpioDwBg&ved=0CDUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22group-fantasy%20analysis%22&f=false) in texts supplied by users.

_Group fantasy analysis_ is a tool central to the pseudoscientific discipline known as [Psychohistory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychohistory).  This field is the brainchild of Lloyd deMause, who first wrote about it in 1974.  

Psychohistory purports to apply statistical methodology to social and political sciences, and thus predict the political future. No definitive work on this methodology has ever been published. 

Psychohistory sounds suspiciously like the central conceit of Isaac Asimovs's [Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series) novels.  Asimov also called his fictional science [Psychohistory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychohistory_%28fictional%29).  The first Foundation novel was published in 1942.

Central to the concept of _group fantasy analysis_ is the hypothesis that hypnotically-boring political speeches contain emotive words that communicate unconscious content. When strung together as sentences these _group fantasy words_ express the true ideology of the speaker. 

This also sounds much the idea of the invisible word [FNORD!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fnord#Origins) first coined by [Kerry Thornley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_Wendell_Thornley) in 1965, and popularized by Robert Anton Wilson in 1975.

#### Why

* To be a demonstration of Hypertag applications
* To be an example of Psychohistory's _group fantasy analysis_ that makes it easy to grasp
* A tool for informally testing _group fantasy_ theory
* Predicting the political future
* Seeing the FNORDS!

#### When

This project started ~2003 as a slapdash web tool whipped up by some friends on IRC.  

It was then resurrected from Archive.org and refactored as a **jTag** app in 2007.  **jTag** was an early ancestor of [Hypertag](http://hypertag.io): a high-level web application language that supports rich, recursive interfaces

This new 2015 version is a Hypertag rewrite.
